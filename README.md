# Frontend Web Dev Class

Personal class repository for ATLAS 5630 Frontend Web Development.

This repository is organized into 2 major sections, `/process/` where I discuss my intentions and process for labs and projects in journal style entries, and `/code/` where the all code written for the labs and projects for this class can be found.
