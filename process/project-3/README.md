# Project 3 Process
## Milestone 1
I'm calling the additional project that us graduate students have to do 'Project 3' just because that feels more organized to me for some reason, even though this whole project comes before 'Project 2' (I just want to keep that project number consistent between me and the undergrads). Anyways, one of the main goals for Project 3 is for it to be related to our main fields of study as a grad student. Unfortunately I feel super uncertain about my field of study, I like everything development related, and my number one priority in grad school right now I feel is just to prepare myself as much as possible for a successful creative software development career. I currently have a good amount of projects in the last 2 years that I have documented (and saved that documentation really quite well), but I haven't published any of it to my portfolio because my current portfolio website for creative technology work is complete garbage.
