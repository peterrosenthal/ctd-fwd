# Project 1 Process
## Milestone 1
### Project Overview
I'm not the biggest fan of cryptocurrencies overall. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the general idea of crpyto, I think it's fine. But I'm not a fan of how the concept of proof of work is absolutely integral to cryptocurrencies functioning at all. And proof of work is a problematic concept environmentally, as there's no way around using electricity to prove such work. This is why you might hear on the news about massive "mining" farms, essentially full power datacenters and supercomputers, chugging through cities worth of electricity per day, all in the name of pulling these coins out of thin air. To be clear, not all cryptocurrencies are created equal, and some people involved in crypto are certainly more environmentally concious than others. There are cryptocurrencies that require a fraction of the energy usage for mining as others, which should be good in theory, but it turns out that mining farms tend to use the same ammount of energy in those cases and just mine more. There are also sometimes mining farms that claim to only be using renewable energy to mine their coins, which once again sounds great except when you look deeper, there are very few places in the world where renewable energy is in so much excess to support mining farms, and these mining farms usually aren't there. That means that even renewable energy miningy farms are most of the time taking away renewable energy that could have gone to normally supporting the human population, so their contributing to the same increase in coal electricity emissions regardless of if they are running on renewable energy or not. Such mining operations might eventually become sustainable, once renewable energy is actually widespread adopted and in excess in their area, but for now they aren't. It seems like most people who are really interested in crypto will respond to environmental concerns with similar future promises, but the world and the environment can't wait for future promises, changes need to happen now.

All this is to say, I want to center the topic of my project on education about how bad for the environment investing in and using cryptocurrencies can actually be, *right now*. My goal is to make an interactive data visualization experience where the user can pick a measurement to measure emissions by, as well as a cryptocurrency to measure. A 3D object of that measurement will then fall from the top of the screen at the rate that the selected cryptocurrency is emitting CO2, as measured by the rate that crypto is traded/mined globally, and the per-trade/per-mine emissions. The data for that will mostly have to come from static numbers I can find through [online research](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/09/20/bitcoins-impacts-on-climate-and-the-environment/), but there is a chance that some API will be used to some level (as discussed in part 3 of this milestone). My goal is to keep the measurment units fun, but also include some very easily understandable ones too. Some example measurments would be: tons of coal (simple), 1hr drive (relatable), and power a city for a day (impactful).
### Wireframe
![A wireframe/mockup of my project, featuring a 3D box which cars are falling into, and a couple of selectors to chose the coin to measure and what to measure the coin by.](../resources/project-1-mockup-wireframe.png)
In this mockup, the box that the measurements are falling into takes up the whole screen/viewport, and cars (the currently selected measurement) are falling from the ceiling. In the top right corner, overlaying the 3D scene, are two selectors: one for the coin to measure, and one for the measurement to use. Currently the coin selector is collapsed and the measurement selector is expanded (this is just to show how the two different states would look).

### API/Javascript Library
My main goal for this project all along actually has been that I wanted to be learning the library [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) and creating something with that. I kinda came up with what library I wanted to use before I came up with the topic, and the topic has just been an excuse to learn THREE.js all along. I've been wanting to learn THREE.js for almost a year now, but haven't had a good reason to up until now. So I've gone through and read the "getting started" section of the [official documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene), and then skimmed the rest of the documentation to get a good idea of the classes, but I have yet to create anything with this knowledge that I've been trying to acquire, so I'm looking forward to putting it to use. I also mentioned I might use an API or two earlier in this milestone, one of the APIs resources given to us for Lab 5 has a lot of cryptocurrency related APIs. At first this concerned me due to my general distaste of crypto (as mentioned earlier), but then it gave me the inspiration to do something about it, and that's what inspired my project topic to begin with. So I bet somewhere in that [list of 40 or so crypto APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#cryptocurrency) I'll be able to find some live/real-time trading and/or mining data, and I can probably use that to feed the visualization rather than some static fixed number I come up with from online research.
